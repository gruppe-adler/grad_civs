# grad\_civs\_mimikry

if mimikry is enabled, grad\_civs will inform civilian *players* 
of certain actions done to them by other players 
that AI civilians would react to.

Example: AI civilians will raise their hands when pointed at with a weapon. 
To give a civilian *player* the chance to pass for an AI civ, 
they will get a hint about s/o pointing their weapon at them
in a way that would cause an AI civilian to raise their hands.
