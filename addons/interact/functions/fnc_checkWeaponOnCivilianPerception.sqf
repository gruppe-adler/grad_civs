assumptions:

* direction you point in equals your unit direction
* to be perceiving you ("pointer") pointing at him, the person pointed at ("pointee")
  must look in roughly the opposite direction, plus a bit lateral perception
* lateral perception of being pointed at and threatened depends on your _relative_ speed! example:
    * if you're standing still, s/o pointing at you from beside you (90° angle) is definitely causing you to raise your hands
    * if you're driving at 150km/h, you dont even notice someone at a 60° angle, because you're focused on the road
